# Analytics
As the project is currently in the conceptual phase, the primary focus is on refining the core idea, defining the product vision,
and outlining the basic functionalities. Implementing a full-fledged analytics solution at this stage might be premature and
resource-intensive. It's more efficient to prioritize the foundational aspects of the project and introduce analytics tools once
the product has a more concrete form and user base.
